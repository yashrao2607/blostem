For bug fixes or regressions, explain why this happened, not just what changed. Otherwise write `N/A`.

- **Root cause:** - **Missing detection / guardrail:** - **Why this regressed now:** ## Security Impact (Required 🚨)

Because ELI executes local OS commands, security reviews are mandatory.

- New OS permissions or hardware capabilities accessed? (`Yes/No`)
- IPC channel payload validation changed? (`Yes/No`)
- Secrets/API keys handling changed? (`Yes/No`)
- Command/tool execution surface expanded? (`Yes/No`)
- Local file system access scope changed? (`Yes/No`)
- **If any `Yes`, explain risk + mitigation:** ## Diagram (if applicable)

For IPC data flows, UI changes, or non-trivial agent logic, include a small ASCII diagram reviewers can scan quickly. Otherwise write `N/A`.
