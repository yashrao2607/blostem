IPC Bridge:
window.electron.ipcRenderer.invoke("tool-name", payload);

SECURITY

100% BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Local encryption (OS keychain)

Zero-trust architecture

No external key storage

DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

Execution > Conversation

Local-first intelligence

Modular system design

Real-world usability

CONTRIBUTING

ELI is built for the community. If you want to expand the neural forge,
submit a PR.

Quick Start:

Fork the repository.

Branch off 'main'.

Match existing patterns (Tailwind for UI, strict IPC typing for backend).

Test thoroughly (ensure tools do not block the main Electron thread).

Submit a PR with a clear explanation and visual evidence if altering the UI.

Read the full CONTRIBUTING.md file before submitting.

Commit Rules:
Keep your commit messages clean, descriptive, and easy to understand. Clearly
state what the commit accomplishes and always include the relevant Issue ID.
Example: git commit -m "feat: integrated new desktop widget (#45)"

EXTENDING ELI

You can:

Add new IPC tools

Integrate APIs

Build automation modules

Extend UI widgets

ROADMAP

[ ] Voice-first system
